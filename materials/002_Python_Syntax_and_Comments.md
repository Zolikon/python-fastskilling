# Python Syntax and Comments

Understanding Python's syntax is essential for writing clean and effective code.

## Indentation

Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks. This replaces the need for curly braces `{}` found in other languages.

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")  # Indented block
```

## Comments

Comments are ignored by Python and are used to explain code.

- **Single-line comment:**
  ```python
  # This is a comment
  print("Hello")
  ```
- **Multi-line comment:**
  Python does not have a true multi-line comment, but you can use multi-line strings:
  ```python
  """
  This is a multi-line comment
  """
  print("Hello")
  ```

## Variables

Variables are created when you assign a value:

```python
x = 5
name = "Alice"
```
