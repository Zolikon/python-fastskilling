# File I/O

File I/O (Input/Output) in Python allows you to interact with files on your filesystemâ€”reading data from files, writing data to files, and manipulating file contents. This is essential for tasks such as data processing, configuration management, and logging.

## Opening Files

To work with files, use the built-in `open()` function. It returns a file object, which you can use to read or write data.

**Syntax:**

```python
file_object = open(file_path, mode, encoding)
```

- `file_path`: Path to the file (relative or absolute).
- `mode`: Mode in which to open the file (see below).
- `encoding`: (Optional) Character encoding (e.g., `"utf-8"`).

**Example: Writing to a file**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8")
file.write("Hello, file!\n")
file.close()
```

**Example: Reading from a file**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8")
content = file.read()
print(content)
file.close()
```

## Reading Files

There are several ways to read file contents:

- **Read entire file:**

  ```python
  with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
          data = file.read()
  ```

- **Read line by line:**

  ```python
  with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
          for line in file:
                  print(line.strip())
  ```

- **Read lines into a list:**
  ```python
  with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
          lines = file.readlines()
  ```

## Writing Files

- **Overwrite file:**

  ```python
  with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
          file.write("First line\n")
          file.write("Second line\n")
  ```

- **Append to file:**

  ```python
  with open("output.txt", "a") as file:
          file.write("Appended line\n")
  ```

- **Write multiple lines:**
  ```python
  lines = ["Line 1\n", "Line 2\n"]
  with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
          file.writelines(lines)
  ```

## With Statement

The `with` statement is the recommended way to work with files. It ensures the file is properly closed, even if an error occurs.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
# File is automatically closed here
```

## File Modes

| Mode | Description                |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| `r`  | Read (default)             |
| `w`  | Write (overwrite)          |
| `a`  | Append                     |
| `b`  | Binary mode                |
| `x`  | Create, fail if exists     |
| `r+` | Read and write             |
| `w+` | Write and read (overwrite) |
| `a+` | Append and read            |

**Example: Open a binary file for reading**

```python
with open("image.png", "rb") as file:
        data = file.read()
```

## Other Useful File Methods

- `file.readline()`: Reads one line at a time.
- `file.seek(offset)`: Moves the file pointer to a specific position.
- `file.tell()`: Returns the current file pointer position.
- `file.truncate(size)`: Resizes the file to the given size.

**Example:**

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
        print(file.readline())  # Reads the first line
        file.seek(0)            # Go back to the start
        print(file.read())      # Reads the whole file
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Forgetting to close files (use `with` statement to avoid this).
- Overwriting files unintentionally with `w` mode.
- Not specifying encoding when working with non-ASCII text.
- Reading large files into memory at once (use line-by-line reading for large files).
